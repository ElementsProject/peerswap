      # Switch to nix-shell for integration tests instead of nix develop.
      # The 'nix develop' command can be unstable in some CI environments,
      # causing issues like "clightning-1: Lost connection to the RPC socket."
      # While the root cause is unclear, switching to nix-shell provides a more stable alternative for CI.
      # For more context, see the issue in this failed job: https://github.com/ElementsProject/peerswap/actions/runs/16064376179/job/45336040866?pr=385
